Hey, I'm **Yu-Xi Chau**. I currently work as a Generative AI Lead at FWD Insurance, where I focus on building GenAI solutions and establishing AI Governance frameworks.

I've been working with data and AI for over a decade, starting as one of the early data scientists in Hong Kong. These days, I'm deep in the world of LLMs, RAG systems, and agentic workflows—building things that actually ship to production.

## Background

I have a PhD in Applied Mathematics (Complexity Science). It gave me a solid foundation in how complex systems work, which turns out to be pretty useful when you're trying to make AI work in real organizations.

Over the years, I've worked across insurance, real estate, retail, CRM, and gaming. The industries change, but the core challenge stays the same: how do you build AI systems that are reliable, governable, and actually deliver value?

## What I Do

Right now at FWD, I lead Generative AI initiatives and AI Governance work. This means:
- Building and deploying GenAI applications
- Setting up the processes for responsible AI deployment
- Making sure our AI systems are ops-ready and maintainable

I'm also into MLOps—building the infrastructure and processes that let teams ship AI reliably. In my previous role, I built out an MLOps platform using Azure ML, Jenkins, and other tools to standardize how we deploy models.

## What You'll Find Here

I'm working on integrating the **Zettelkasten method** into my personal knowledge management workflow. Expect posts about that, along with thoughts on AI systems, MLOps, and whatever else I'm exploring at the moment.

## Outside of Tech

I'm a history nerd. I read a lot about the Ming Dynasty and Hong Kong history when I'm not coding.
