Hi, I'm **Yu-Xi Chau**, a seasoned technology leader with a career built at the intersection of Data Science, MLOps, and AI Governance. As one of Hong Kong's early data scientists, I have spent over a decade translating complex data challenges into tangible business value across diverse industries. I am passionate about building not just AI models, but entire systems and frameworks that enable organizations to innovate responsibly and at scale.

## My Professional Journey

My foundation is in academia, where I earned a PhD in Applied Mathematics with a focus on Complexity Science (specifically, Interacting Particle Systems). This rigorous background in stochastic systems gave me a unique lens through which to view and solve complex business problems.

My professional path has taken me through a wide range of industries, including **insurance, real estate, retail, CRM, and gaming**. While the context changed, my mission remained the same: to leverage data and AI for strategic advantage. I have developed particularly deep expertise in the **insurance sector**, leading projects that delivered significant value to both operations and agency channels.

Though often titled a Data Scientist, my roles have required me to be a versatile problem-solver, wearing the hats of a Data Engineer, MLOps Architect, and AI Governance Lead as needed to get the job done.

## Core Expertise & Philosophy

I believe that successful AI implementation is not just about algorithms, but about people, processes, and platforms. My expertise is centered around these three pillars.

*   **Executive Leadership & Strategy**: As a senior manager, I have a proven track record of leading and mentoring cross-functional teams of business analysts, project managers, and engineers. I excel at aligning technical strategy with business objectives and fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation.

*   **MLOps & The AI Factory**: I am passionate about building the "factory" for AI. In my recent leadership role, I spearheaded the standardization of the machine learning deployment lifecycle. By designing and implementing a robust MLOps platform using **Azure Machine Learning, Jenkins, Bitbucket, and Jira**, we significantly accelerated our time-to-market while ensuring safe, governed, and reliable deployments.

*   **Generative AI & Modern Applications**: I have hands-on experience in the delivery of cutting-edge Generative AI solutions, including building enterprise-level applications with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic workflows**.

*   **Technical Toolkit**:
    *   **Languages**: Python (Primary), R, C++
    *   **Cloud & Platforms**: Microsoft Azure (Azure Machine Learning)
    *   **DevOps & MLOps**: Jenkins, Bitbucket, Jira, AI Foundry

## On This Website

This site is a space for me to explore my interests further. One of my current projects is optimizing my personal knowledge management by integrating the **Zettelkasten method** into my note-taking workflow, a topic I plan to write about here.

Expect to find articles on MLOps, AI Governance, lessons from my journey in tech leadership, and the practical application of AI in business.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not immersed in technology, I have a deep passion for history. I'm an avid reader, particularly drawn to the histories of the Ming Dynasty and Hong Kong.
