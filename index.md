Hey, I'm **Yu-Xi Chau**. I currently work as a Generative AI Lead at FWD Insurance, where I focus on building GenAI solutions and establishing AI Governance frameworks.

I've been working with data and AI for over a decade, starting as one of the early data scientists in Hong Kong. These days, I'm deep in the world of LLMs, RAG systems, and agentic workflows—building things that actually ship to production.

I have a PhD in Applied Mathematics (Complexity Science), which gave me a solid foundation for working with complex systems. Over the years, I've worked across insurance, real estate, retail, CRM, and gaming—the industries change, but the core challenge stays the same: how do you build AI systems that are reliable, governable, and actually deliver value?

Right now at FWD, I lead Generative AI initiatives and AI Governance work, which means building and deploying GenAI applications, setting up guardrails for responsible AI, and making sure our systems are production-ready.

On this site, I write about AI systems, MLOps, and whatever else I'm exploring. I'm also working on integrating the **Zettelkasten method** into my personal knowledge management workflow. Outside of tech, I'm a history nerd who reads a lot about the Ming Dynasty and Hong Kong history.
