Hi, I'm **Yu-Xi Chau**, and welcome to my digital space. Here, I explore the intersection of MLOps, AI Governance, and practical business solutions.

I am a Data Science veteran turned **MLOps Engineer** and **AI Governance Lead**. As one of the earliest Data Scientists in Hong Kong, my career has been a journey of constant evolution, spanning industries from gaming and retail to properties and insurance.

My journey is rooted in a PhD in Applied Mathematics (specializing in Complexity and Stochastic Systems), which built the foundation for a career dedicated to applying machine learning to solve real-world business problems. While my title has often been "Data Scientist," I've worn many hats, delving into data management, data engineering, and, most recently, specializing in the critical areas of MLOps and AI Governance.

My primary focus is on ensuring AI is not just innovative, but also reliable, scalable, and deployed responsibly. In my previous role as a Senior Manager, I led initiatives to standardize and accelerate model deployment, creating a safe and efficient platform for our teams. This work extended to delivering cutting-edge **Generative AI** solutions, including chatbots built with RAG and agentic workflows.

On this site, I'll be sharing insights from my professional work. I also plan to write about some of my personal interests, including my passion for history (especially the Ming Dynasty and Hong Kong) and my experiments with productivity systems like the Zettlekasten method for knowledge management.
